MPL's Dafny code parses the TestVectors JSON recursively.
i.e. GetTests(Json) = (Json[0], GetTests(Json[1:]))
The MPL Test Vectors generates more than the default recursion of 1000.
MPL test vectors exceeds Python's recursion limit when parsing the JSON, which needs >1 call per test vector.
(Other Crypto Tools languages are limited by memory; Python's explicit limit on function calls is unique.)
When using this internal Crypto Tools TestVectors library, set recursion limit to 10,000.
(This value is totally arbitrary and should be increased if this isn't enough.)
