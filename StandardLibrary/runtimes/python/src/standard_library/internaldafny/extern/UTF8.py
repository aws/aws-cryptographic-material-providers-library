"""
Extern UTF8 encode and decode methods.

Note:
Python's `.encode()`/`.decode()` handle surrogates with 'surrogatepass'.
However, the results of 'surrogatepass' does not comply with Dafny's expectations.
Dafny expects a strict interpretation of Python's Unicode handling.
Python represents Unicode characters based on their presence in the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP).
The BMP includes characters from U+0000 to U+FFFF (or, 0 <= ord(chr) < 65535).

If a character is inside the BMP, Python internally represents it as a single UTF-16-encoded code unit.
ex.
"\u2386" == 'âŽ†' --> ord('âŽ†') == 9094 --> 9094 < 65535 --> in BMP
Since "\u2386" is in the BMP, Python internally represents it as 'âŽ†':

```
>>> s = "\u2386"
>>> s
'âŽ†'
```

In contrast, if a character is outside the BMP, Python internally represents it
as a unicode-escaped string using surrogate pairs.
ex.
"\uD808\uDC00" == 'ð’€€' --> ord('ð’€€') == 73728 --> 73728 > 65535 --> outside BMP
Since "\uD808\uDC00" is outside the BMP, Python internally represents it as "\uD808\uDC00":

```
>>> s = "\uD808\uDC00"
>>> s
'\ud808\udc00'
```

However, the `.decode()` method with 'surrogatepass' leaves '\ud808\udc00' as 'ð’€€',
which does not match Dafny's expectation of the literal interpretation of this field.
To correct this, the Decode extern implementation
re-encodes any characters outside the BMP,
then decodes them under the expected decoding.
