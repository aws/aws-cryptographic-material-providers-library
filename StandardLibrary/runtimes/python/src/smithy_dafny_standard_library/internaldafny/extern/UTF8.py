Extern UTF8 encode and decode methods.

Note:
Python represents Unicode-escaped characters based on their presence in the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP).
The BMP includes characters from U+0000 to U+FFFF (or, 0 <= ord(chr) < 65535; or, 0x0 <= hex(chr) < 0xFFFF).
Note that this is the range of characters that can fit into a single UTF-16 code unit (2 bytes).

If a Unicode-escaped character is inside the BMP, Python internally represents it
as a single UTF-16-encoded code unit.
ex.
"\u2386" == 'âŽ†' --> ord('âŽ†') == 9094 --> 9094 < 65535 --> in BMP
Since "\u2386" is in the BMP, Python internally represents it as 'âŽ†':

```
>>> s = "\u2386"
>>> s
'âŽ†'
```

However, if a Unicode-escaped character is outside the BMP, Python internally represents it
as a Unicode-escaped character using surrogate pairs.
ex.
"\uD808\uDC00" == 'ð’€€' --> ord('ð’€€') == 73728 --> 73728 > 65535 --> outside BMP
Since "\uD808\uDC00" is outside the BMP, Python internally represents it as "\uD808\uDC00":

```
>>> s = "\uD808\uDC00"
>>> s
'\ud808\udc00'
```

Dafny expects its strings to be UTF-16 code units.
However, the `.decode()` method with 'surrogatepass' leaves '\ud808\udc00' as 'ð’€€',
which, if passed directly to Dafny, will be interpreted as a single UTF-32 code unit,
instead of the desired two UTF-16 code units.

To correct this, the extern implementations
convert between Dafny Seqs of UTF-16 code units (handling multi-byte surrogate pairs)
and Dafny Seqs of UTF-8 bytes.
