# Validate that the released artifact is usable
# by installing it from PyPI
# then running tests from source against the published artifact.

# For the MPL package, which has the ESDK as a downstream dependency,
# also validate that the released artifact is usable by the ESDK
# by downloading the ESDK from source
# and running tests with the newly published MPL artifact.
