# AWS Cryptographic Material Providers Library Concurrency Testing Framework

Welcome to the AWS Cryptographic Material Providers Library Concurrency and Parallelization
Testing Framework 🎉!

This framework helps set up scenarios that we would like to run in a parallel or multithreaded environment.

Some things to keep in mind when you add tests. Think about how you will be creating resources per
thread and what kind of state you need to keep between tests.

Examples:
- [Test regular DynamoDB Client TransactWrites](./ConcurrentConditionCheckWriteTest.java)
- [Test ACTIVE branch key reads while branch key creation is inflight](./StorageWriteReadConcurrencyTests.java)
- [Test branch key reads while branch key versioning is inflight](./StorageVersionReadConcurrencyTests.java)
