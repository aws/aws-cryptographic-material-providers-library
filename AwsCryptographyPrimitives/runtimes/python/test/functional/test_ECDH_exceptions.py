This file asserts properties about the exceptions
pyca raises for different public keys.

These assertions provide evidence
that pyca (in particular, OpenSSL backend)
raises a particular exception for one "infinity" public key
that it does not raise for other public keys.

These demonstrate that the "infinity" exception is not raised
for neither noncanonical infinity public keys
nor for other "short" keys.

These findings validate that the MPL
will correctly detect an "infinity" public key
and will fail to load an "infinity" public key
from a DER encoding.

This test suite is solely intended
to document and validate the expected behavior from pyca
in a particularly sensitive failure case
where the MPL should understand failure modes.

This test suite is NOT intended to require
that pyca should continue to raise these exceptions.
If the behavior from pyca changes,
we should first understand why the behavior changed,
then update the test suite if needed.
